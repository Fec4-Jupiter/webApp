### Initial Repo Setup

- [ ] For the team, create a new [GitHub Organization account ](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account).

- [ ] Add all your team-mates as members to the new org.

- [ ] Create repo for the `web application` off of which your team can work.

  - **DO NOT copy the example folder**

  - No sensitive info!

- Each member should:

  - [ ] Confirm have access to `org repo`
  - [ ] Init git workflow into this `central repo`

- [ ] Update `README.md` files to create through setup instructions
- [ ] Every team must [configure Trello](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/3230/blocks/94/content_files/Front End Capstone/exercises/ticketing.md) as their ticket management system, with a sprint-based setup.
- [ ] File your first tickets in Trello as investigative/design tickets
  - Don't do any work that isn't ticketed. *Capture everything that you're doing, all your work, in the form of a Trello ticket*.
- [ ] Begin to flesh out your web app files using the front-end technology of your choice (feel free to consult [the list of tech choices](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/3230/blocks/94/content_files/Front End Capstone/exercises/tech_choices.md)).
